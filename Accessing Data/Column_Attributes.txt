Length: Variable names can be up to 32 characters in length.
Characters: Variable names can consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_).
Start with Letter or Underscore: Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore. They cannot start with a digit.
No Special Characters: Avoid using special characters like spaces, hyphens, periods, or other punctuation marks within variable names.
